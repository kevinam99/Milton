Most people, myself included, have trouble sometimes understanding what kids might be saying these days. So, I decided to come up with this extension that quickly tells me what certain words mean from the [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/).

This project is at the mercy of Urban Dictionary's API which may be deprecated any time.

### Requirements
- JavaScript
- A web browser, preferably Chrome or Firefox.


### Downloading the extension
* For Firefox: You can download and install the add-on from Firefox add-ons (I'll add the link once the add-on is public) or you could install it as a temporary add-on. This is how you would have to go about it  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Clone the repo.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Open Firefox and hit the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+A to open the add-ons setting.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Click on the gear icon and select "Debug add-ons".  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. In the new window that opens, click on "Load Temporary Add-on...", navigate to ```milton/``` and select ```manifest.json```. That's      


* For Chrome:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Clone the repo.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and enable Developer mode.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Click on Load unpacked and select the folder, ```milton```. Now you're good to go!  



### Using the extension
There are two ways one can use the extension:
1. Highlight text: Highlight the word of which you want the definition, right click on it and click on 'Find Definition on Urban Dictionary using Milton.' On clicking this option, a new window will open with the Urban Dictionary webpage showing the definitions of the highlighted word.

2. Click on the extension in the browser bar: On clicking the extension, just enter the word you want to search, click on the button that says, "Tell me what this means!" and lo and behold, you'll get the top two definitions within the extension.

I would have put this up on the Chrome webstore but they want me to pay $5 for it and I'm not sure I'd pursue writing browser extensions again.
