# Milton 
Most people, myself included, have trouble sometimes understanding what kids might be saying these days. So, I decided to come up with this extension that quickly tells me what certain words mean from the [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/).

This project is at the mercy of Urban Dictionary's API which may be deprecated any time.

### Requirements
- JavaScript
- A web browser, preferably Chrome or Firefox.


### Downloading the extension
* For Firefox: You can download and install the add-on from [Firefox add-ons]().

* For Chrome:  


### Using the extension
There are two ways one can use the extension:
1. Highlight text: Highlight the word of which you want the definition, right click on it and click on 'Find Definition on Urban Dictionary using Milton.' On clicking this option, a new window will open with the Urban Dictionary webpage showing the definitions of the highlighted word.

2. Click on the extension in the browser bar: On clicking the extension, just enter the word you want to search, click on the button that says, "Tell me what this means!" and lo and behold, you'll get the top two definitions within the extension.
